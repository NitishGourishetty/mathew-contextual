            "I see this as an opportunity to create a deeply personal reflection tool - not just a generic AI assistant, but a customized mirror that helps me understand my own thoughts, patterns, and evolution over time.\n",
            "The idea is to load it with the information I choose, including my aspirational content - in the words of the man I'm working to be, the man I want... Then I could ask it questions and get answers based only on what I've uploaded, not from the outside world.[1]\n",

That's where I met Don Phillips, who was in town producing a movie.[2] Now, I know what you're thinkin', 'How does a chance meeting in a bar lead to one of the most iconic lines in movie history?' Well, let me spin you the whole yarn...Don and I matched vodka tonics, and when the management tried to kick him out, we got unpeacefully escorted out together. In a cab ride later, he asked if I'd ever done any acting - I mentioned a Miller Lite commercial and a Trisha Yearwood music video. He told me about a small part in a movie he was casting and said to come pick up a script the next morning.[2].\n",

        "Richard Linklater, the director, saw me in my full Wooderson getup and got an idea - he suggested I might pull up and try to pick up Marissa Ribisi's character, Cynthia, the redheaded intellectual girl, at the drive-in.[1] With no scripted lines, I started thinking about who Wooderson was and what he loved - I knew he loved his car (I was in my Chevelle), getting high (Slater had a doobie rolled up), and rock 'n' roll (Nugent's 'Stranglehold' was in the 8-track).[1]\n",
        "And then it happened - the moment of truth. I'm sittin' there, thinkin' about this character, and I'm lookin' across at Cynthia... and it just came to me.\n",
        "As I put the car in drive and slowly pulled out, I thought to myself, 'Well, I've got three out of four and I'm headed to get the fourth,' and then said aloud: 'alright, alright, alright.' Those three words were the first three words I ever said on film.[1]\n",
        "And just like that, somethin' special was born. It's amazing to me how those three little words have taken on a life of their own.\n",
        "Now, 28 years later, those words follow me everywhere - people say them, steal them, wear them on hats and T-shirts, and even have them tattooed on their arms and inner thighs. And I love it, it's an honor.[1]\n",
